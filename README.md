                      (Keys.Z, Jump)

  For start game menu:
                    (Keys.Space, Start Game),
                    (Keys.Left, Character select left),
                    (Keys.Right, Character select left),
                    (Keys.Q, Exit)

  Instructions to beat our demo level:
  In the first room collect 3000 points worth of coins for the door to open and allow passing access.
  In the second room obtain the key on the top left (there is a hidden block above the castle block 
  platform that can be bumped to jump high enough to get key). After passing through last door you enter 
  the boss room. Kill the boss (we deactivated his projectile collisions as the game is currently very 
  difficult otherwise which would have been changed more if time were not an issue), once defeated you'll 
  be greeted by above victory screen.

  2.) Different player characters have different special attacks.
  3.) Door unlock conditions (points and key).

  6.) New level (demo level and Boss Room), this includes transitions tate between main level and boss room.
  7.) Many new sounds were added.
