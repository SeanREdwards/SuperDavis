7. Specific Comments - Some of the code smells I was looking for include large class, duplicated code, long methods and extremely long lines of code (God Line).  After reviewing this file, I can not really see any of these code smells.  The class is an appropriate size for what its purpose is.  I couldn't see any long methods or extremely long lines of code in the file as well.
8. Hypothetical Change - After reviewing this file, I can't really say that there is a hypothetical change I would make.  After 6 sprints on this application we have pretty much taken care of all our technical debt and code quality changes that could have been made.
