7. At first glance the code was very readable and easy to understand.  The variable names were clear as to what they were being set to as well.  I don't see any duplicated code or meaningless variables being used or any other code smells that jump out at me.

The variables have describing names so that I can easily tell which ones are which and what they represent.  The methods also have very descriptive names that makes the code easy to follow and know whats going on.  There are no redundant comments in the code as well.
