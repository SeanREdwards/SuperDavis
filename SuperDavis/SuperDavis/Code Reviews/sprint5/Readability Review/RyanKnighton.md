7. Specific Comments - Some code smells that I was looking for in particular are classes with too much code, descriptive class names or redundant variables.  After reviewing the file I can see that it is a little bit on the long side.  It's almost 200 lines of code which would be hard to fit on one screen.  The methid names in the file have very descriptive names which allows for easy reading but some of the methods have code commented out which may lead to another level of complexity.  All variable names are clear as what the mean.
