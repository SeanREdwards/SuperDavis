7. At first glance, the code has consistent tabs and spacing that helps make the code very easy to read.  The variables have describing names so that I can easily tell which ones are which and what they represent.  The methods also have very descriptive names that makes the code easy to follow and know whats going on.  There are no redundant comments in the code as well.  
The one thing that makes the code not very readable are all the magic numbers for the coordinates.  This makes it kind of difficult to see whats going on with the code.  I'm sure this was done soley for this sprint and will be corrected in future sprints.
