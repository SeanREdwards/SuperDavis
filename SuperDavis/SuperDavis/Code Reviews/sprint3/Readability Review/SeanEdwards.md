7. With the focus of this code review on readability a quick scanning of this program was all one 
needs to see that the code itself is very readable. However the readability coincides with the
fact that the entire WorldCreator.cs file is composed of switch cases. With the switch case checking
cases that are directly associated with class types its easy to see how the world creator parses an
XML file to obtain the starting locations for objects generated on a particular world.


Comments like "TBD" above commented out code gave footprinting to be able to tell what code was still
being worked on.
