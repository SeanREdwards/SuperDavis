7. At first glance the code was very readable and easy to understand.  The variable names were clear as to what they were being set to as well.  I don't see any duplicated code or meaningless variables being used or any other code smells that jump out at me.

The methods in the class file are short and only consist of a few lines each that make the code easy to follow and very concise.  Comments are meaningful and help to understand Jason's thoughts when writing this file.  You can also see where he left off to finish later the a "TBD" comment.  This makes it clear that Jason is carfully laying out his options and carefully thinking of the best way to handle this task.
